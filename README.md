# TwoPartHybrids

Scripts for stochastic simulations of entire, multi-stage hybrid crop breeding programs to compare: 

•	1 conventional breeding program not using genomic selection; 
•	3 conventional plus genomic selection breeding programs, and;
•	2 breeding programs implementing the two-part strategy.

The six different breeding programs can be compared across independent replicates with different levels of genotype-by-year interaction variance. Each replicate should consist of: 

(i)	a burn-in phase shared by all strategies so that each strategy had an identical, realistic starting point, and; 
(ii)	a future breeding phase that simulated 'n' years of future breeding with each of the different breeding strategies.

To mitigate against loss of genetic variance, two crossing schemes can be compared:
(i)	a circular crossing scheme; and
(ii)	a maximum avoidance of inbreeding crossing scheme.

Default specifications result in costs being equalized across all differnt breeding strategies. Based on equal genotyping and phenotyping costs ($15 per individual/plot)
